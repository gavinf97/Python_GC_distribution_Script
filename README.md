## Python GC Distribution Script
## Description
'GC_organism_gene.ipynb'

Using Biopython the script takes in Genbank accession codes for organsims genomes and runs an analsyis to determine if there is a link between gene length distibutions and the size of the organisms genomes. Best for viruses and small bacteria as larger genomes will take a long time to download and resolve.

### Sample input accession file
'genbank_accessions.txt'

Sample acessions usable with the script to see the ouput of the analysis
